# The name of the Storm topology
bullet.topology.name: "bullet-topology"

# Enable metrics collection for the topology. The registered metrics classes under bullet.topology.metrics.classes are loaded.
# This enables the default storm built-in metrics. See: http://storm.apache.org/releases/1.0.1/Metrics.html
# Depending on your cluster configuration, things such as on/off heap usage, cpu usage, garbage collection time/types
# send/receive queue sizes and overflows, execute/ack/fail counts and other such system metrics can be obtained.
bullet.topology.metrics.enable: false

# Enable the collection of the Bullet built-in metrics. These will be sent to your metrics classes. This is in addition
# to the storm built-in metrics. Currently supported are:

# Counting metrics: These behave like org.apache.storm.metric.api.CountMetric but do not reset their value when getValueAndReset()
# is called. This custom metric is defined in com.yahoo.bullet.storm.AbsoluteCountMetric.
#   1. bullet_active_queries : A metric that counts the number of queries active per JoinBolt. Note that this metric will
#                              increase and decrease as queries come and go. Make sure to configure the emit period accordingly
#                              otherwise short running queries may not be even counted.
#   2. bullet_created_queries : A metric that counts the number of queries created per JoinBolt.
#   3. bullet_improper_queries : A metric that counts the number of semantically incorrect queries created per JoinBolt.
#   4. bullet_rate_exceeded_queries : A metric that counts the number of queries that exceeded the configured rate limit.

# Averaging metrics: These are org.apache.storm.metric.api.ReducedMetrics
#   1. bullet_filter_latency: A metric that computes the average latency to filter a single record in the Filter Bolt. The latency is
#                             subtracted from record tuple that the Filter Bolts receive from your Data Source component. If the
#                             record tuple is of the format (record, timestamp), then Bullet WILL try to read your timestamp as a Long,
#                             and subtract it from the time when it finishes filtering a record to compute the filtering latency. You
#                             will get an RuntimeException if your tuple contains more than just the record but the second position
#                             is not a Long.
bullet.topology.metrics.built.in.enable: false
# The time period mapping from metric name to seconds for emitting the metric. This is passed to Storm when the metrics are registered.
# A default value for all metrics can also be set by using the "default" key.
bullet.topology.metrics.built.in.emit.interval.mapping:
   bullet_active_queries: 10
   default: 10

# You can list full package prefixed class path to your custom implementation. The class must extend
# org.apache.storm.metric.api.IMetricsConsumer. Additionally, it must provide a static method with signature
# public static void register(Config, BulletConfig), where  Config is of type org.apache.storm.Config and
# BulletConfig is of type com.yahoo.bullet.BulletConfig.
# Your register method is responsible for calling registerMetricsConsumer to add itself to the provided
# Config. You can add settings such as your argument for the prepare method call, or your parallelism for the
# IMetricsConsumer in this register method. In Storm version 1.0, there is no equivalent for adding custom metrics.
# It may be possible using passing a kryo serialization but it is unsupported by bullet-storm-0.10.
bullet.topology.metrics.classes:
  # By default, the Storm LoggingMetricsConsumer (it just logs with level INFO to the console) is added.
  - "com.yahoo.bullet.storm.CustomLoggingMetricsConsumer"

# The parallelism setting controls the number of executors used for each component.
bullet.topology.query.spout.parallelism: 2

# This is the number of ticks for which a query will be buffered past its expiry in order to wait for
# the final windows/results to trickle in from the Filter Bolts. If tuples from your your Filter Bolts take longer than
# (bullet.topology.tick.spout.interval.ms * this setting) to get to the Join Bolt, that data will be LOST and will not
# be in the final result for the query. If you have bullet.query.window.disable set to true, then this is the value
# that is used in waiting for your final (and only) intermediate results to arrive from your Filter Bolts.
# The defaults make this (100ms * 3) or ~0.3s after the query is done for the final results to come back.
# All queries without windows or with record based windows are buffered past their expiry using this.
bullet.topology.join.bolt.query.post.finish.buffer.ticks: 3

# This is the number of ticks for which a query will be delayed in the Join Bolts before it is marked as started. This
# delay in the Join Bolt offsets the windows in this stage so that windows from the Filter Bolts arrive slightly before
# the window is marked as closed in the Join Bolt. This only applies to queries with windows that are time-based.
# If tuples from your Filter Bolts arrive sooner than this (bullet.topology.tick.spout.interval.ms * this setting), that
# data is lost. For this reason, you should make sure the bullet.query.window.min.emit.every.ms is at least twice this.
# The defaults make this (100ms * 2) or ~0.2s.
bullet.topology.join.bolt.query.pre.start.delay.ticks: 2

# Bullet Storm uses ticks underneath the hood as a "clock"-like mechanism to do metadata and query updates (checking if queries
# have expired) etc. This is particularly relevant if your data volume is low since your queries depend on these ticks to
# emit data etc appropriately. This setting controls the how frequently a tick happens - number of milliseconds between ticks.
# The bullet.query.window.min.emit.every should be several times greater than this value. See
# bullet.topology.join.bolt.query.pre.start.delay.ticks. Also, this cannot be lower than 10 ms.
bullet.topology.tick.spout.interval.ms: 100

# The Loop Bolt switches your PubSub into QUERY_SUBMISSION mode to loop back metadata messages to the rest of the
# topology. If you need to change settings for your publisher in this mode that is different from the settings
# used in the ResultBolt, override them here. They will be merged into the config and replace the existing settings in
# your Loop Bolts. This setting needs to be a Map if provided. The example below pretends that your PubSub settings
# start with bullet.pubsub.custom. You will provide yours.
# Example:
#
# bullet.topology.loop.bolt.pubsub.overrides:
#   bullet.pubsub.custom.publisher.setting: 1
#   bullet.pubsub.custom.nested.publisher.setting:
#     foo: bar
#     bar: baz
bullet.topology.loop.bolt.pubsub.overrides: {}
