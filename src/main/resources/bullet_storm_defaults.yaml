# Enable metrics collection for the topology. The registered metrics classes under bullet.topology.metrics.classes are loaded.
# This enables the default storm built-in metrics. See: http://storm.apache.org/releases/1.0.1/Metrics.html

# send/receive queue sizes and overflows, execute/ack/fail counts and other such system metrics can be obtained.
bullet.topology.metrics.enable: false

# Enable the collection of the Bullet built-in metrics. These will be sent to your metrics classes. This is in addition
# to the storm built-in metrics. Currently supported are:

# Counting metrics: These behave like org.apache.storm.metric.api.CountMetric but do not reset their value when getValueAndReset()
# is called. This custom metric is defined in com.yahoo.bullet.storm.AbsoluteCountMetric.
#   1. bullet_active_queries : A metric that counts the number of queries active per JoinBolt. Note that this metric will
#                              increase and decrease as queries come and go. Make sure to configure the emit period accordingly
#                              otherwise short running queries may not be even counted.
#   2. bullet_created_queries : A metric that counts the number of queries created per JoinBolt.
#   3. bullet_improper_queries : A metric that counts the number of semantically incorrect queries created per JoinBolt.

# Averaging metrics: These are org.apache.storm.metric.api.ReducedMetrics
#   1. bullet_filter_latency: A metric that computes the average latency to filter a single record in the Filter Bolt. The latency is
#                             subtracted from record tuple that the Filter Bolts receive from your Data Source component. If the
#                             record tuple is of the format (record, timestamp), then Bullet WILL try to read your timestamp as a Long,
#                             and subtract it from the time when it finishes filtering a record to compute the filtering latency. You
#                             will get an RuntimeException if your tuple contains more than just the record but the second position
#                             is not a Long.

# The time period mapping from metric name to seconds for emitting the metric. This is passed to Storm when the metrics are registered.

# You can list full package prefixed class path to your custom implementation. The class must extend
# org.apache.storm.metric.api.IMetricsConsumer. Additionally, it must provide a static method with signature
# public static void register(Config, BulletConfig), where  Config is of type org.apache.storm.Config and
# BulletConfig is of type com.yahoo.bullet.BulletConfig.
# Your register method is responsible for calling registerMetricsConsumer to add itself to the provided
# Config. You can add settings such as your argument for the prepare method call, or your parallelism for the
# IMetricsConsumer in this register method. In Storm version 1.0, there is no equivalent for adding custom metrics.
# It may be possible using passing a kryo serialization but it is unsupported by bullet-storm-0.10.
bullet.topology.metrics.classes:
  # By default, the Storm LoggingMetricsConsumer (it just logs with level INFO to the console) is added.

# Bullet uses tick tuples underneath the hood as a "clock" mechanism to do metadata and query updates (checking if queries
# have expired) etc. This setting controls the how frequently a tick happens - number of seconds between ticks.
bullet.topology.tick.interval.secs: 1

# This is the number of ticks for which a query will be buffered past its expiry in order to wait for
